# NeUI

A New UI for GitHub notifications

The goal is to re-implement the experimental UI that was created for notifications back when Notifications:Next launched, and then iterate on it to create a better UI for catching up on changes to the projects you are watching.

Here is a screenshot of what the UI looked like before it was removed from GitHub.com. The current status is nowhere near this.
